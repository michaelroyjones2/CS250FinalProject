**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this**
I usually interpret user needs by a direct approach. I will use the user stories created from this direct interaction with the 
potential users to develop necessary requirements.




**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
I have not had any professional experience in program development, only educational experience. I think that 
adapting an agile approach in a group setting would be a great adaptation. Although, in a small environment or single person
assignment I don't know how it would be too beneficial.





**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
Working cohesively with your peers, communicating effectively. Doing your job and whenever possible, assiting others if they need 
help completing their job.
